Currently, I am manually checking all the files and photos to see if the data is all correct.

end goal:the end goal is to have the progam check all the data against each other, and if they don't then tell me what to investigate.

midgoal:for now, I want to just create a text file that extracts all the data I need to check from the files.

for now: just create the text file "certified_check.txt", and we want the program to extract one piece of data from one file. that data shall the date in the file "3. Tax Invoice.pdf"
