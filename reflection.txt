How I would re-do this app.

//library imports

//global constants

e.g.

const downloadsPath = path.join(os.homedir(), 'Downloads');
const desktopPath = path.join(os.homedir(), 'Desktop');

// array for all the pdf names


//array for holding validation checking data

//renaming function imports

//pdf data extraction imports

const main = async () => {

}


main ();


would the if statments be better put inside the functions in their seperate files
or should they be in the main() so I can see when certain function are or arne't called depending on the presence of certain data.
